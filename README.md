Database systems coursework project for designing conceptual and logical models for the Racketminster sports scheme

This repository contains my coursework for the Database Systems module. The project focuses on designing a database for Racketminster, a sports scheme for racket-based activities. It involves both conceptual and logical data modeling using UML notations.

Content includes a full report outlining the requirements, EERD, relational schema, assumptions, and business rules, and a conceptual Entity-Enhanced Relationship Diagram (EERD) 

This project was completed as part of my second year Database Systems module in the BSc Data Science and Analytics course.
